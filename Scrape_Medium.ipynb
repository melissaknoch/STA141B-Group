appeal instead use range output numpy array typically easy work data science arange return evenly space value within give interval along start stop point also define step size data type necessary note stop point value include array output linspace similar slight twist linspace return evenly spaced number specify interval give start stop point well number value linspace evenly space numpy array especially helpful data visualization declare ax plot may run drop column panda sum value numpy matrix surely point let use example drop column know many time write line code actually know declare axis probably deduce set axis want deal column set want row favorite reason atleast remember call shape attribute panda dataframe give u back tuple first value represent number row second value represent number column think indexed python row columns much like declare axis value crazy right familiar sql concept probably come lot easy anyhow function essentially way combine dataframes specific way difficult keep track best use time let review concat allows user append one dataframes either next depending define axis merge combine multiple dataframes specific common column serve primary key join much like merge combine two dataframes however join base index rather specify column check excellent panda documentation specific syntax concrete example well special case may run think apply map function make pandas dataframes specifically series familiar series pretty similar numpy array part apply send function every element along column row depend specify might imagine useful especially format manipulate value across whole dataframe column without loop last certainly least pivot table familiar microsoft excel probably hear pivot table respect pandas function create

math get even good tidyverse data science continue much much math statistic trust python go give mileage okay guess learn python regret python hard keep marketable robot take well sure python pretty easy language automate lot task cool thing even need python data science much scripting machine learn mean well tool use python get insight data sometimes involve machine learning time data science simply create chart matter fact even learn python use tableau advertise make everyone organization data scientist use product wait buy tableau license data scientist okay let take sale pitch grain salt may clueless know data science making pretty visualization excel sure get admit slick marketing though chart data fun stage leave painful part work data clean wrangle transform load yes suspect value learn code let talk python actually hold maybe learn alteryx another software call alteryx allow clean wrangle transform load data great us interface blend data oh god please stop tool want learn python alteryx tableau okay sorry try make life easy avoid code maybe company buy license use anyway learn python need learn library pandas manipulate data frame matplotlib make chart actually

different within jupyter notebook step data analysis stage notebook visualize every step almost like create story share others communication storytelling critical part data science sound like powerpoint already confused oh god notebooks much automate streamlined make easy trace back step analysis come think remember people even like notebook code usable easy modularize code outside notebooks case need turn software product data science software engineering let get distract much press thing learn first data science obviously need data course great place start scrape web like wikipedia page dump hard drive wait try accomplish well get data practice scrap web page parse beautiful soup give u lot unstructured text data work confuse finish great book sql think query table rather scrap web sql typical way access data well lot cool thing unstructured text data use categorize sentiment social medium post natural language processing nosql great store type scrap data store massive amount without concern make usable analytics heard term nosql sql wait think something big data right well first big data people really use term anymore cool talk like like lot excite technology pass peak gartner hype cycle find niche place nosql basically product big data movement grow platform like mongodb okay call nosql nosql stand sql support data structure beyond relational table however nosql database usually use sql rather proprietary query language mongodb language compare sql oh gosh terrible say nosql platform query language wrong sql feel ya nothing wrong sql around decade unstructured data craze opportunity something different scale wildly way possible however guess folk conclude value keep sql around make analytics much easy much fact many nosql big data technology scramble add sql layer shape form sql pretty universal language even people find difficult learn ugh okay gather nosql critical anymore learn data scientist unless somehow job require sound like safe know sql think yes suppose right unless gravitate towards data engineer data engineer yeah data scientist kind break two profession data engineer work production system help make data model usable less machine learn mathematical modeling work leave data scientist probably necessary since hr recruiter see past data scientist title come think want data engineer would prioritize learn apache kafka nosql apache kafka pretty hot right venn diagram may help get data scientist title somewhere circle ideally overlap another discipline alright idea whether want data scientist data engineer point let move go back scrap wikipedia page well serve data input natural language processing thing like create chatbots like microsoft tay bot go smart enough forecast sale help launch new product right amount inventory inherent risk becomes racist theoretically might ingest news article maybe create model identify trend result business decision recommendation really really hard come think may good place start okay natural language process chatbots unstructured text data probably go thing probably note lot data science nowadays silicon valley company like google facebook deal lot unstructured data like social medium post news article obviously lot influence define data science rest u use business operational data form relational database use less exciting technology like sql yeah sound right guess also devote unstructured data talent largely mine user post email story advertise nefarious purpose might find naive bayes interest somewhat useful take body text predict category pretty easy implement scratch right naive bayes kind cool see value unstructured data beyond move work lot tabular data spreadsheet table lot record number almost sound like want forecast statistical analysis yes finally get somewhere solve real problem neural network deep learn come whoa hold horse go suggest start normal distribution mean standard deviation maybe calculate probability linear regression two excel miss yes correct lot excel get lot flexibility write script like vba visual basic okay go start pretend say excel great statistical operator decent linear regression model need separate normal distribution regression category item much easy script python rather create hellish formula whose length become metric also use amaze library get lot powerful option different regression machine learn model okay fair enough guess segue mathematical model territory come math stuff start well conventional wisdom say linear algebra build block lot data science start multiply add matrix together call dot product something time important concept like determinant eigenvectors pretty much place find intuitive explanation linear algebra take grid number another grid number something lot sound really meaningless bore give use case machine learn linear regression build neural network lot matrix multiplication scale randomize weight value okay matrix anything data frame sound similar actually hold rethink let walk statement back practicality need linear algebra oh come seriously learn linear algebra practicality probably need learn linear algebra library like tensorflow tedious bore anyway ultimately might want get little bit insight library work start use machine learn library completely ignore linear algebra uncertainty unsettle trust show gratitude spar another rabbit hole welcome ugh also forget actually use tensorflow use kera make tensorflow much easy work speaking machine learn linear regression really qualify machine learn yes linear regression lump machine learn tool bag awesome excel time call machine learn practitioner technically yes might want expand breadth bit see machine learn regardless technique often two task regression categorization technically categorization regression decision tree neural network support vector machine logistic regression linear regression execute form model pros con depend situation wait machine learn regression effectively fit curve point pretty much model like linear regression crystal clear interpret advance model like neural network definition convolute difficult interpret neural network really regression nonlinear function may seem impressive variable hundred thousand variable start get interesting well put way sure image recognition regression yes image pixel basically become input variable numeric value remind wary curse dimensionality basically mean variable dimension data need keep become sparse one many reason machine learn unreliable messy require ridiculous amount label data likely lot question go problem like schedule staff transportation solve sudoku machine learn solve problem well go type problem folk would say data science machine learn operation research seem like practical problem operation research nothing data science actually decent amount overlap operation research give lot optimization algorithm machine learning use also provide lot solution common ai problem like one mention algorithms use solve kind problem well definitely machine learn algorithms people know good algorithms around decade tree search metaheuristics linear program operation research methodology use long time much good job machine learn algorithms category problem everybody talk machine learn algorithms optimization problem satisfactorily solve quite awhile method make headline since believe first ai hype cycle focus algorithms several decade ago nowadays ai hype machine learn type problem solves well image recognition natural language processing image generation etc people propose use machine learn solve schedule problem something simple sudoku wrong pretty much yes machine learn deep learning whatever hype today usually solve discrete optimization problem least well people try result machine learn regression everybody make fuss robot ai jeopardize job society fit curve really dangerous much ai regression well people find clever application regression like find best chess move give turn discrete optimization also car calculate direction turn yes quite bit hype regression many application one task still reconcile disconnect keep reading article deepmind replicate intelligence chess game beat human player starcraft machine learning algorithm beat human player game mean go replace job next many human starcraft gamers threaten take job confused

black box air craft record happen cockpit main purpose li record useful information code execution help programmer mainly debug anything go awry also improve performance code reduce execution time difference log instrumentation logging record actionable information critical failure run time structure data intermediate result later use code multiple log level debug info warn error acceptable development test phase however avoid cost production log minimal contain information require human attention immediate handle ii instrumentation record information leave logging would help u validate code execution step work performance improvement necessary always good data instrument much information possible validate code execution record information task name intermediate result step go etc would help u validate result also confirm algorithm follow intended step invalid result strangely perform algorithm may raise critical error would catch log hence imperative record information improve performance record time take memory utilized variable would help u improve code make necessary change optimize code run fast limit memory consumption identify memory leak common python instrumentation record information leave logging would help u validate code execution step work performance improvement well data less code optimization code optimization implies reduce time complexity run time well reduced space complexity memory usage complexity commonly denote x also know representation x dominant term take polynomial complexity metric measure algorithm efficiency example let say nest loop size n take second run followed simple loop take second run equation time consumption write time take n representation drop term negligible n tends inf well coefficient coefficient scale factor ignore less control term optimization flexibility please note coefficient absolute time take refers product number loops time take run whereas coefficient represent number loop double loop single loop drop low order term equation hence process goal replace least efficient part code well alternative low time complexity example n well common killer code loop least common bad loop recursive function try

analyze berlin rental price one thing heard people recently move berlin work newcomer complain imagined berlin expensive statistic possible price range apartment know beforehand could ask high salary job application process could consider option google check several rental apartment website ask several people could find plausible statistic visualization current market price come idea analysis want gather data build interactive dashboard could select different option apartment situate berlin mitte balcony equip kitchen would show price range alone would help people understand apartment price berlin also apply machine learning would able identify driver rental price practise different machine learn algorithms idea data science project start look data ton amaze data repository kaggle uci ml repository dataset search engine websites contain academic paper datasets alternatively could use web scrap cautious old data everywhere search information rental price berlin find many visualization

extraction date take late one recent additionally agency would increase decrease price apartment month tell nobody want apartment price would decrease conversely tell many request agency increase price sound like good explanation everything ready start analyze data know data scientist love seaborn well many static visualization derive insight however interactive dashboard help stakeholder find useful insight many amazing tool tableau microstrategy take less minute create interactive dashboard one select important component see price would change fairly simple dashboard could already provide insight price berlin newcomer could good user driver rental apartment website already data visualization see price distribution room fall distribution room apartment reason room apartment situate center city course reduces price data gather winter also get outdated however point rental website could frequently update statistic visualization provide transparency question visualization help identify important attribute feature could use machine learn algorithms feature use uninformative algorithm produce bad prediction strong feature even simple algorithm produce pretty decent result rental price project price continuous variable typical regression problem take extracted information collect follow feature order able predict rental price however one feature problematic namely address apartment around unique address different granularity around unique postcode could convert dummy variable precious information particular location would lose give new address either google get use external api follow four additional feature give apartment address could calculate distance stadtmitte city center car duration walk trip near metro station number metro station within one

miss value certain feature would best way convert categorical feature numerical one many question give detail one majority beginner encounter mistake firstly visualize distribution continuous feature get feel many outlier distribution would make sense many way visualize example box plot histograms cumulative distribution function violin plot however one pick plot give information data see distribution normal bimodal histogram helpful although histograms good start point box plot might superior identify number outlier see median quartile lie base plot interesting question would see

help see number outlier feature fact outlier apartment base rent without bill either atelier small shop student dormitory low rent sometimes miss value due various reason exclude every observation least one miss value end reduce dataset many way impute value mean median make sure calculate imputation statistic train data avoid data leakage test set rental data also extract description apartment whenever quality condition type apartment miss would impute description description contain information algorithm depend implementation work directly categorical data one would need somehow transform

assume rental data column follow value ground floor loft maisonette loft loft ground floor labelencoder turn introduce ordinality mean loft maisonette algorithm like decision tree deviation type encode feature would fine apply regression svm might make much sense rental price dataset condition encode follow quality standardization bring continuous variable scale mean one variable value another standardization range regularization common way reduce overfitting use within many regression algorithm however important apply feature standardization rental price euro fit coefficient would approximately time large fitted coefficient price cent penalize large coefficient mean penalize feature small scale prevent feature standardize apply another reason standardize algorithm use gradient descent gradient descent converges much faster feature scale take understand universal answer depend many factor regression firstly pay attention residual plot metric sometimes logarithmization target variable lead good model result model would still easy understand however still transformation could interest take square root many answer stack overflow regard question think residual plot rmse raw log target variable explains well rental data derive logarithm price residual plot look bit good algorithm regression suffer collinearities data coefficient become unstable math svm might might suffer collinearity due choice kernel algorithms suffer multicollinearity could use feature interchangeably different tree without affect performance however interpretation feature importance get difficult

disruptively simplify national discourse original artwork fanny algeyer graphic web designer reputationsquad contribution giulio zucchini panda open source python library build top numpy allow fast analysis well data clean preparation easy way think panda simply look python version microsoft excel one cool thing like panda fact work well data wide variety source excel sheet csv file sql file even webpage anaconda simply install panda terminal command prompt use conda install panda anaconda computer install pandas terminal use pip install pandas series array similar numpy array matter fact series build top numpy array object differentiate series numpy array series access label index basic syntax create pandas series data object type dictionary list even numpy array index signifies axis labels series index go create series various object type note important note index axis optional mean decide pas index pass pandas create default index value len data like whenever create series python dictionary panda set key index series set value correspond data point show grab information series grab information series way python dictionary performing arithmetic operation series operation series do base index use mathematical operation pandas computation use value index result value thereafter convert float loose information panda unable find match series give nan value dataframe data structure data align tabular form row columns panda dataframes make manipulate data easy select replace column row even reshape data basic syntax create dataframe let create dataframe random number see column actually pandas series share common index hence safe say dataframe collection series share index example create dataframe series select columns dataframes use bracket notation easily grab object dataframe way do series let grab column name grab single column return series go ahead confirm data type return use type grab multiple column result dataframe add columns dataframe create new column define like already exist dataframe easily add new column either create afresh exist column like show remove dataframe remove row column use function specify row column important note panda permanently drop whenever use method unless tell panda want accidentally loose data go ahead confirm call df permanently delete set like select row dataframe select row call location row use take label name take index position row also select subset row columns use column notation specify row column want like numpy say want row c conditional selection panda allow perform conditional selection use bracket notation example return row w say want return value column x w go ahead try df df w x get one line abstraction also achieve break multiple step use multiple condition get value dataframe combine logical operator example return value w x use reset index dataframe index look entirely way want easily reset reset dataframe index column name index panda default index value len data new index expect permanently reset index specify say set index dataframe similarly specify column want use index label use function create new column call id set new index index multiindex index hierarchy multiindex simply array tuples tuple unique create list array use array tuples use crossed set iterables use let create multiindex turple go ahead grab row multiindex use like see first two column dataframe df name give name use like cross section row columns use method easily select data particular level multiindex example say want grab level num lot time use pandas data miss point pandas automatically miss point nan null value hence either drop value use fill say dataframe use method tell pandas drop row column one miss value drop row drop column similarly use method replace miss value dataframe desire value let replace nan value could also choose fill miss value specific column row let replace miss value column mean value mean column hence replaces second row similarly occur permanently set groupby grouby allow group together row base column perform aggregate function sum mean median standard deviation etc use method group row base column call aggregate function see result mean company count use count method get number time item occurs dataframe describe method use get overview dataframe look like give u summary dataframe index like layout could use method get different layout concatenate merge join dataframes concatenation concatenation basically glue dataframes together concatenate dataframes keep mind dimension match along axis concatenate list dataframes concatenate method since specify axis want concatenation occur default pandas us row axis join row together want concatenation occur along column set notice bunch miss value dataframe value index want concatenate hence work make sure data contains information correctly axis merge use function panda allow merge dataframes together way merge sql table syntax merge dataframes leave right left signifies dataframe appear left side right signifies dataframe appear right side signify whether merge operation handle intersection inner union outer lastly signify key column merge occur key column similar across dataframes merge function occur two dataframes key column merge like also merge multiple key simply pass key join join convenient method combine column two potentially dataframes single dataframe join similar merge differs join method occurs index key instead column unique value simply distinct value dataframe three main useful method find unique value dataframe use find unique value dataframe instead display unique value choose count number unique value dataframe use lastly could decide return number time unique value show column use apply method method use call custom function dataframe imagine function example broadcast function element column also apply function dataframes let say want get length string sometimes may define function end use instead define function several line code could simply use lambda expression version function example could represent square function ln lambda expression get dataframe attribute attribute column index name dataframe say sure column name dataframe contain space character could simple get attribute sort order dataframe imagine want display dataframe certain column display ascend order could easily sort use see value display low high also note index stay attach row information lose finding null value say large dataset panda make easy locate null value use pivot table may already familiar pivot table excel pivot table table summarize data another table enable automatically group slice filter sort count total average data store one table dataframe create pivot table use syntax data value represent column want datapoints make index column like group data column represent columns dataframe define read pivot table example get nan value value match specific point use method pandas allow access data wide variety source excel sheet csv sql html reference file make sure directory jupyter notebook read csv file use output content file dataframe like write csv file create dataframe store file use like confirm data save go ahead read csv file create use read excel file excel file good source data use import data excel file keep mind pandas import data excel file import macro image formula else macros image formulas excel file cause method crash say excel file let go ahead output content keep mind every excel file contain one sheet example refers particular sheet want read write excel file like csv create dataframe store file use like read html read data html file need install lxml terminal run use let tell pandas read table html page since different table page access specific table want use index number len table example return second table page reach end tutorial congratulation complete lesson good knowledge panda use data preparation need practice practice practice get

use type function check type specific variable operator python behave differently depend variable type different method one look examples create float point intergers string booleans python python list basic sequence type use type store collection value one list contain value type possible one list contain another nested list value commonly use list mix python type create new one use square bracket like fruit pineapple apple lemon strawberry orange kiwi use index get element element list python index start therefore first element list index also use negative index access element last element list index one last one index also something call list slice python use get multiple element list use like sliceable step important understand list work behind scene python create new list store list computer memory address list store variable variable contain element list contain reference list copy list equal sign like reference copy variable instead list value want copy actual value use list function slice dictionary use store pair helpful want value index unique key python create dictionary use curly brace also key value separate colon want get value give key like key let see example compare list versus dictionary imagine movie want store rating also want access rating movie fast movie name use two list one dictionary example ex machina code return index ex machina movie case usage dictionary intuitive convenient way represent rating add update delete data dictionary want add update data simply use code key value want delete pair like del key also check give key dictionary like key function piece reusable code solve specific task write function use def keyword like however many function python like max iterable key min iterable key type object round number

interviewer ask generally want follow step string ctes filter aggregate join filter use aggregate use group join use well join rinse repeat filter aggregate data join write efficient sql join expensive process want few possible row join two table together sometimes aggregate first possible usually able limit size table join least clause two important note join clause cte sql process join first word follow inefficient entirety table would join together filter data proper way express us ctes filter join like efficiency gain come fact join perform filtered few possible number row probably able solve majority problem filter aggregate join process describe occasionally though get tricky problem sql need window function like group clause window function separate table several chunk operate chunk individually unlike group row combine example easy way grasp imagine table line item report revenue along state come task determine percent revenue line item contribute state total revenue trick realize need compare individual value revenue particular line item aggregate value sum line item revenue particular state time need something like window function good bet query might

successfully complete typical data science sql interview round sql arsenal need couple tool first one easy grasp union union vertical version join whereas join combine table ctes horizontally use join

transaction want single query tell many type transaction select constant type field case sale buy two table end one big table group count single query answer wish two table instead structure one

one common distribution see let examine distribution little depth normal normal distribution expect mean median center tall point distribution likewise expect distribution roughly symmetrical mean normal distribution define metric mean standard deviation normal distribution expect value lie within standard deviation lie within standard deviation lie within standard deviation note standard deviation distribution proportional width distribution present distribution format histograms show exact data different way illustrate let u show cluster data also know binomial distribution note different normal distribution bee swarm see large cluster data around also small cluster around density plot histogram pick examine box plot would able see clearly finally alter bin density plot histogram also change interpretation data interpretation data change dramatically depend plot examine even though data could learn anything data plot plot likely much detail whilst plot little detail notice plot totally hide second cluster data plot simple true data therefore best plot note way figure best plot examine underlie data would therefore recommend use either bee swarm density plot small bin width high number bin first examine data much detail possible produce simplified version data usually want compare distribution see obvious difference example compare treatment control group prefer way use either density plot box plot let look example measure effect treatment fertilizer adoption amongst farmer rwanda see density plot box plot quite good viewing difference group however bee swarm plot histogram busy able quickly draw conclusion though useful scenario see outlier therefore data present density box plot fulfill criterion simple read true data descriptive graph treatment control group two group look different sure quantify uncertainty statistical testing exist ever sample population see glossary example might measure adoption fertilizer sample east african farmer randomize trial try infer something east african farmer generalize sample whole population want able understand effect actual population make decision program intervention therefore want compare population sample hypothesis testing allow u test difference underlie population give key assumption hypothesis test certain assumption underlie example assumption commonly use test know use test test assumption test many hypothesis test sample size calculation assume normally distribute data remember mean data symmetrical mean however often would like conduct hypothesis test data examine hypothesis test data shortly first know data normally distribute number approach present two common method let take follow data set hopefully clear data might normal data b certainly look note clear asymmetry test normality thoroughly plot ideal normal distribution data top know calculate relationship qqplot plot perfect normal distribution solid diagonal line actual data marker circle top see plots data follow normal solid diagonal line distribution well however examine data plot b see substantial deviation normal line deviation clearly random follow trend random deviation would occur equally many time either side line quantify extract learn late lesson essentially measure close point diagonal line scale value b respectively enough look data realize plot b also pick cutoff call anything anything normal another approach use shapiro test conduct hypothesis test whether data normal key part data higher normal distribution often use cutoff ensure normality anything would class approach complementary would recommend plot run shapiro test report report let look shapiro test specifically data distribution shapiro test show systematic deviation normal line strongly suggest data b normal convince data normally distribute tackle data later run hypothesis test commonly use hypothesis test want convince use welch test instead remember access welch test r call function add argument welch test well suit unequal sample size unequal variance often come across real world run simulation demonstrate danger use welch test unequal variance data plot histogram derive two test run simulation many many time remember probability difference group observe purely chance real difference group two population mean mean accept null hypothesis reject alternative hypothesis see glossary know real difference population accept null hypothesis see flat distribution see time definition implies chance false result frequentist statistic note real situation already know difference population see right hand histogram welch test result flat good match know data however leave hand histogram performs poorly report small mean chance u wrongly conclude significant difference group much high precise likely make incorrect conclusion use rather welch test could lead accept program product innovation actually effect wasting time money moral story use right test right time data normal always use welch test ignore few assumption welch test data need different test hold normally distribute data data often confront data real life scenario value approach likely example look loan repayment establish bank look adoption popular unpopular product example distribution show farmer rwanda loan repayment percentage solar light adoption rate clearly see density plot data case let u use diagnostics outlined make sure wow terrible look qqplots really low data far normal however would still like hypothesis test data let compare method test intervention increase solar adoption use incorrect data welch test also incorrect data wilcoxon test appropriate test data welch test wilcoxon test see get different result welch test report would indicate typical threshold whereas wilcoxon test indicates see depend test use come completely different result welch test would lead u believe intervention useful whilst wilcoxon test make clear intervention seem effect therefore important use right test right data imagine test intervention harmful farmer use wrong test conclude intervention safe add wilcoxon test library see calculate robust data however way report data also dependent shape distribution normal data simply report mean confidence interval example mean ci kg per acre could also report mean standard error long clear reporting data little tricky generally report median quartile median remember normal distribution symmetrical asymmetry distribution prevent u report cis sems stdevs base symmetry concept relate hypothesis test idea statistical power power use calculate sample size also interpret result rct trial low power mean result less reliable may make false conclusion intervention important use correct power calculation much way important use right hypothesis test power calculation dependent data distribution common power calculator use r fine normally distribute data calculator require effect size simple way measure effect treatment effect size basically difference mean sample divide standard deviation sample mean unit standard deviation effect size mean data shift amount equal standard deviation include function calculate effect size use cohen equation way calculate effect size let use calculate power study normal data participant use function pwr library function require follow argument together call inp effectsi library pwr length argument return number element list name norm see power ideally want power good probability detect effect accurately note calculate sample size need power fill power argument set n null slightly different equation assume equally size control treatment group null inp effectsi make loop look power different sample size plot line indicate power plot like one help see sample sizes power reasonable would strongly recommend plot power curve low estimate effect size small size effect might see upper estimate effect size large effect might see run complete example let u imagine want run rct test examines effect new interest rate fertilizer adoption two group control group interest rate treatment group interest rate reduce point interest rather understand customer mean think see increase fertilizer adoption treatment plot power curve like follow please examine code make sure understand plot allow u see would require large sample size n approx would need participant trial control treatment detect change adoption power plot data like allows flexible decision make highly recommended fine normal power calculation power solution make function mcpower calculate power distribution require data expect data sample treatment control sample size size argument please make sure understand code comfortable use compare approach understand need use correct test correct data let run simulation experiment data difference sample therefore would expect see statistically significant difference note whilst normal power test hypothesis test test mean power calculation test overall similarity distribution let run simulation calculate power need test difference two population different mean mean several hundred simulation mc test see histograms distribution know assume distribution incorrect whereas mc method require assumption meet see mc method generally high power often correctly identify significant difference sample unlike performs poorly note normal data result normal power calculation mc method quite similar compare two distribution effect size yield power standard method mc method respectively see plot present data simple true underlie data also see calculate power normal data rct happen get assumption wrong include brief illustrate decision need make originally publish see error post please leave comment likewise anything require explanation

involve manipulate analyze visualize data interactive programming environment last year two languages become standard choice task r python strength weakness eventually might benefit know interview best strategy pick one learn really well whichever choose cover post go basic language go interview feeling solid ready whiteboard allude best advice give spread thin try learn everything every data science interview participate interviewer interviewee allow candidate solve problem either language ultimately learn either totally fine general guideline make choice python fully functional programming language technically r get minute design fill function program language like c java unlike c though python lot modern convenience like automatic memory management dynamic type view python strength data science ability serve real backend language production system mean model data scientist potentially implemented little effort live website software product word primary interest write prototyping production code choose python r hand feel like analysis language r support standard c data structure technique array loop really excels work rectangular data set like see typical spreadsheet program unlike spreadsheet though still take advantage computer science concept like iteration abstraction make order magnitude powerful something like excel additionally r de facto language quantitative researcher academia mean cut edge statistical technique often available r package long make way place include python primary workflow involve offline analysis data visualization especially want access statistical package r want really go wrong amazingly useful chance make either language whatever data science task try accomplish choose language favor become familiar language best interactive environment make life infinitely easy term organize save code visualize data managing package r want go download free version rstudio really say enough good thing much easy data analysis rstudio compare use command line ide manages package provide access help file display visualization give nice customizable text editor along console whole environment organize four pane format keep eye everything python head jupyter get set notebooks different environment rstudio useful instead local ide jupyter provide notebook let separate code executable chunk run piece code analysis one time output display inline right code generate clear output come analysis also jupyter notebook easy share others make work reproducible whichever language choose need know program basic data type structure iteration abstraction possible unlikely get question directly concept usually type stuff reserve software engineering interview definitely need familiar concept solve whiteboarding challenge might receive typical data science interview data type way describe type information store python option numeric integer long integer float boolean binary true false string combination character r type exist addition factor order variable level represent different string lot depth topic term different data type store encode generally need know stuff interview aware give unit data need fall one type type dictate operation able perform data example multiply two numeric variable together course able two string data structure way group atomic piece data like number string together single object python list commonly call array language tuples order collection data also something call set unordered collection variable duplicate finally python dictionary represent ordered collection pair r vector similar python list except element need share type list matrix data frame iteration important concept computer science deeply connect data essentially way perform operation item within data structure two big category vectorized operation loop vectorized function way apply single function every element data structure get one element back example could take list vector five different number get back new vector square root loop hand let write code block execute item give structure often slow little flexible since execute arbitrary code output anything loop exist much form r python vectorized function hand take many form language differ quite significantly r entire apply family vectorized function read python list comprehension vectorize numpy package among option might seem like lot learn concept find different option various way apply fundamental concept take data structure something element abstraction mostly form function way write block code reuse supply different input example could write function take single numeric input multiply get square value pas number function get square output theory concise manually square number time need example might save much time code function get much complex point write function repetitive task make code much readable concise python r let user define function slightly different syntax section felt like lot new information recommend start basic r python tutorial datacamp nice one r codeacademy good one python data manipulation represent one broad category typical interview question like sql standard interviewer provide sample data set ask output specific result important thing type interview solid grounding r python package data manipulation try solve problem without one difficult inefficient
